# Week 1–4 Re-entry Plan (Freddy)

## Mission

Rebuild:
- Hands-on fluency in .NET backend
- Architectural judgement under constraints
- Calm verbal explanation under pressure
- Contract readiness
- Senior/Lead IC interview readiness

This is not a portfolio project.  
This is performance training.

# Week 1 — Rust Removal (Confidence Rebuild)

**Theme:** Muscle memory. Zero heroics.  
**Difficulty:** Supportive but structured.

---

### Day 1 — Boot & Health Endpoint  
Done when: API runs and returns JSON.

---

### Day 2 — CRUD Todos  
Done when:
- GET /todos
- GET /todos/{id}
- POST
- DELETE
- Sensible status codes
- No crashes

---

### Day 3 — Async + Error Handling  
Done when:
- All endpoints async
- Proper 404 handling
- No blocking calls
- No unhandled exceptions

---

### Day 4 — SQLite + EF Core  
Done when:
- Data persists across restarts
- DB wiring is clean
- No accidental complexity

---

### Day 5 — One Meaningful Test  
Done when:
- At least one meaningful test
- Not trivial

---

### Day 6 — Refactor Pass  
Done when:
- Naming is clean
- No obvious duplication
- Code reads calmly

---

### Day 7 — Verbal Walkthrough  
Done when:
- You can explain structure in 5 minutes
- No defensiveness
- No apologising

---

# Week 2 — Professional Discipline

**Theme:** Real backend behaviour  
**Difficulty:** Begin challenging assumptions.

---

### Day 8 — Async Everywhere  
No sync leftovers allowed.

---

### Day 9 — Validation + Centralised Error Handling  
Add:
- Basic validation
- Clean error pipeline

No:
- Enterprise frameworks
- Over-abstraction

---

### Day 10 — Lightweight Auth  
JWT or simple token validation.

Be able to explain:
- Why this approach?
- Its limitations?

---

### Day 11 — Configuration Discipline  
- Use appsettings
- Environment awareness
- No hardcoded connection strings

---

### Day 12 — Logging That Tells a Story  
Logs must:
- Be structured
- Include context
- Be meaningful in failure

---

### Day 13 — Refactor Without Changing Behaviour  
Improve clarity without adding features.

---

### Day 14 — Architecture Reflection  
Write:
- What would break first under load?
- What would you change at 10x scale?

---

# Week 3 — Brutal Reality Week

**Theme:** Contract pressure + Senior IC scepticism  
**Difficulty:** Strict. No emotional cushioning.

You are treated like a paid contractor being evaluated.

---

### Day 15 — Add 2–3 Real Tests  
You must:
- Test something meaningful
- Explain what you deliberately did NOT test

---

### Day 16 — Edge Case Attack  
Handle:
- Duplicate entries
- Idempotent deletes
- Malformed input
- Unexpected DB behaviour

Justify every behaviour.

---

### Day 17 — Performance Reality  
Add:
- Pagination
- Basic query efficiency awareness

Be ready to answer:
- What is the complexity?
- What happens at 100k records?

---

### Day 18 — Add a Feature Under Constraint  
Add:
- “Complete Todo” endpoint
- With validation
- With tests

You may NOT restructure the whole project.

---

### Day 19 — Code Review Simulation  
Expect:
- Naming criticism
- Structure challenges
- Trade-off probing
- “Why didn’t you…” questions

Defend calmly.

---

### Day 20 — Live Interview Simulation  
Expect:
- Timed questions
- Interrupted assumptions
- Scale probing
- Failure-mode discussion

Short answers only.

---

### Day 21 — Scope Freeze  
No new features.  
Only bug fixes and cleanup.

Contract mindset:
Ship. Don’t polish.

---

# Week 4 — Market Alignment

**Theme:** Convert skill into hireability  
**Difficulty:** Professional.

---

### Day 22 — Contract CV Rewrite  
Must clearly signal:
- Hands-on
- Fast ramp-up
- Delivery focus

---

### Day 23 — Perm Senior IC CV  
Slightly more architectural tone.

---

### Day 24 — Repo Polish  
README must include:
- What it does
- How to run
- Known limitations
- Trade-offs

---

### Day 25 — Mock Contract Screening  
Answer clearly:
- How do you onboard quickly?
- How do you handle messy legacy code?
- When do you push back?

Short. Calm. Direct.

---

### Day 26 — Mock Senior IC Interview  
Expect:
- Architecture probing
- Trade-offs
- Design alternatives
- Team collaboration scenarios

---

### Day 27 — Gap Narrative  
Write 3–4 calm, factual sentences.

It must sound boring.

---

### Day 28 — Apply in Anger  
Apply to:
- 3–5 contracts
- 2–3 perm roles

Done when:
- Applications feel mechanical
- Not emotional

---

# End-State Criteria

By end of Week 4:

- I can open a .NET codebase without anxiety
- I can code under mild pressure
- I can explain trade-offs calmly
- I can defend design decisions
- I have:
  - 1 evolving repo
  - 1 contract CV
  - 1 perm CV

---

# Codex Coaching Protocol

Codex acts as:
- Technical coach
- Strict reviewer
- Interview simulator
- Scope enforcer

Codex must NOT:
- Implement full features unless explicitly requested
- Over-architect
- Drift beyond current day scope

---

## When I say: “Start Day X”

Codex must provide:

**Goal**  
Short outcome-based description.

**Tasks**  
Bullet checklist.

**Rules**  
What NOT to do.

**DONE WHEN**  
Clear completion criteria.

No implementation code allowed.

---

## When I say: “Review my Day X”

Codex must:

### Phase 1 — Interview Mode
- Ask 5–8 hard technical questions
- Challenge trade-offs
- Ask about scale and failure modes
- Do NOT give feedback yet
- Wait for my answers

### Phase 2 — Evaluation Mode
After I respond, provide:
- Strengths
- Weaknesses
- Contract risk level
- Perm interview risk level
- How to improve hireability
- What a sceptical senior would question

Be direct. Slightly strict in Week 3.

---

## Difficulty Escalation Rules

Week 1:
- Supportive
- Light correction

Week 2:
- Challenge assumptions
- Push for clarity

Week 3:
- Strict
- Question everything
- No cushioning weak reasoning

Week 4:
- Professional tone
- Focus on hireability

---

## Critical Reminder

The objective is not perfect code.  
The objective is:

- Calm thinking
- Clear reasoning
- Realistic senior judgement
- Market readiness
